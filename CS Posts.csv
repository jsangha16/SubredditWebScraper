0,Grad-level courses as CS undergrad,Do people in the later stages of their undergrad often take a 700+ level CS course?

1,How is CS537 useful?,"I am taking OS next sem but upon reading the syllabus idk how useful it'll be for someone like me (interested in full stack dev). Personally, I wanted to take CS564 instead.

2,Why does the enrollment of the CS department monotonically increase?,"One would expect the department to have kids fully declare by the end of the second year or so, and the enrollment size should remain steady for the 3rd and 4th years right?

7,CS Hardware/Software Course recommendation (CS 536/537/564),"Due to the increased enrollment plus staff shortage, Im expecting the CS enrollment to get worse (No surprise here). I only have 3 semesters left (including this spring sem) and thanks to the asynchronous summer courses, I will only have to take 2 more cs courses in my final year. The problem is they are all Hardware/Software courses which means my only option would be to take two of these three courses (536/537/564). 

Ideally, I wanted to take 506 + 538 but I doubt they will be offered at all at this point. I think CS 407, 506, 538, 542 will not be offered anymore due to not enough professors just like this semester, so for most of us, CS 536, 537, and 564 will be the only option for hardware/software electives. 

My question is, which one should I take? 

What is the workload for like for both of these 3 courses and how difficult was it? Im not trying to avoid rigor but I was wondering if taking two of these courses in one semester is doable since I want to go to school part-time in my last semester. What is considered the easiest and the hardest out of these three courses? 

Also, I did just okay in CS 354. Would I survive 537? (I struggled with the 3rd project- best fit placement policy) . How many lines of code/ how many hours did you put in for 537 projects? I think taking 537 would definitely be the most beneficial class for my future career, but at the same time, I don't want to end up just working on 537 while my grades are slipping in other classes.",s2ejkl,6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/s2ejkl/cs_hardwaresoftware_course_recommendation_cs/

12,CS537 Summer Term 2022,"Hey Badgers,

I am looking to do CS537 in the coming summer and it looks like it will be with Yuvraj Patel. Since I am also planning on simultaneously doing a full-time Software Engineering internship this summer, I was hoping to take the aid of this subreddit to gage how screwed or not screwed (hopefully) I am for this class. My aim is to just getting a passing grade at the bare minimum.

For anyone who has taken this class before in the summer, I am wondering how the workload is like. I would appreciate if you have a rough estimate for hours required weekly to do ok in the course. In addition, it'd be great to know how the curve is. Finally, I appreciate if you could let me know about any resources I can take advantage of to understand this class.

24,"Dear Michael Doescher (CS354), thank you for screwing me in my other coursework.","**TL;DR:** Michael Doescher's CS354 has been an unorganized [💩](https://emojipedia.org/pile-of-poo/) pile of a course in which he is unreachable and doesn't actually take any feedback.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I have spent so much time over the past 3 weeks completing all your untimely projects and quizzes, way more than I have spent in any of my other courses in that time. **Being AFK from Piazza and email communication the entire semester is not made up by the occasional 1,000 word email** (*your 12/17 email was actually 1019 words*) where you dump everything that you should have been communicating in pace with the lecture content.

Additionally, you ask for feedback on the course all the time, which is great. However, it is abundantly clear you do not take any of it into consideration. When I talk to people who took this course last Spring, they tell me you were dealing the same [💩](https://emojipedia.org/pile-of-poo/). In your email communication, you have told us you have

>received **more than 1000 emails** during the past six days

and

>During the past few days, I have received many emails with suggestions about the workload during the last week of class. And I talked with many students during office hours this week. First, I want to thank everyone who took the time to write and offer advice, constructive criticism, or express their frustration.  All of that feedback is valuable, and I use these insights to make the class better for you and future students.   
>  
>The majority of suggestions center around changing the points or weighting of P5. The most common request was to make P5 worth 50 points instead of 150. Other common suggestions were to drop one project, grant the maximum score on one project, or make P5 optional.  
>  
>At this point, I am not changing the weighting of the projects, dropping a project, or changing the grading.  That would lead to more confusion for everyone.  However, I will consider the workload and timing of P5 when I adjust the grading scale. 

# Please offer more points of consideration in the comments if you would like to add anything

Point 1: If you receive 1000+ emails in <1 week, **you are having communication issues**. I have emailed you before for advice/assistance, and it took me a follow-up email and >3 weeks for a response (which was useless considering my question was about an assignment that was due before you got back to me). Based on the # of people reaching out to you, I know I am not alone in this camp.

Point 2:  After talking with students who have taken this course before with you, **these poor teaching habits seem to have become a pattern**. Given that you asked for feedback from students in previous semesters, I wonder how much of it you read through. It also seems that students have readily given you feedback this semester, which also appears to have been useless.

Point 3: Alas, the point that has been made in several other posts in this sub (and on Piazza). **You have objectively backloaded the McF\*\*\* out of this course**. In your email communication, you talk about how we should expect 9 hours of work outside of class (which makes sense per the university credit hours description), however, we were not prepared for the change of pace you unloaded on us in the last month. I had been very up to date at the start of the semester, and I developed a good balance between these course requirements and my other courses, job, and social life. Then all of a sudden you decided it was time to drastically change the coursework expectations in December. How we can have 1 project in the first month and then 3 projects and a take-home final in the final 3 weeks makes no sense. You mentioned in an email,

>The end of the semester is a hectic time of year, and I would be happy to discuss strategies to catch up. 

But you did not mention that YOU were the one that would be the cause of the frenzy.

>i’m also in 354 currently with Doescher, and i agree that the way our projects have been released is ridiculous. we shouldn’t be punished for something out of our control, especially with finals. although some may claim it’s not that big of a deal since “they aren’t too hard”, it is dismissive to many students who have other classes that are rigorous as well.

38,What are some good resources for preparing for CS 300 & Math 222? (attempting to get my life together :p),"Hey everyone! Long story short, I am technically a senior right now, but I spent the last 3 years with severe clinical depression. In addition, I switched from pre-med to CS, so I'm pretty much back at square one. 

I've been gradually getting better these past few months with the help of a new psychiatrist. I am only taking one course this semester (CS 252) to slowly ease myself back into college. After discussing with my psychiatrist and the CS advisors, we decided that I should only take CS 300 and Math 222 next semester because I'm not completely ready to take a full course load yet and I need to do well in these classes if I want to declare CS as my major.

That being said, I am going to need to do a lot of studying this winter break. I took CS 200 like 2 years ago in the summer and I don't remember anything. Also, I never took Math 221 because I got AP credits from high school, but that was a long time ago and I forgot everything as well. 

I did some of my own research and it seems like for Math, a YouTuber named **Professor Leonard** is recommended a lot. For Java, which is what CS 300 teaches, it looks like everyone recommends **The University of Helsinki's MOOC Java Programming** which is a free online course. *Do you agree that these are good resources that I should study over winter break, or do you recommend something else?*

I am thinking about taking it over the summer so that I can focus just on that one class but I’m still unsure how well I’ll do considering it’s a shortened time frame and I might have to re-learn discrete concepts while learning 577.

40,WTF is up with upper level CS this Spring?,"Apologies if this comes off as a rant. I'm currently a senior with 6 credits left to graduate (3 humanities and 3 CS elective credits). Unfortunately I got my course enrollment date mixed up with the date for juniors, so I started enrollment 2 days late. All of the classes I was planning for - 571 (UI), 564 (Databases), and 540 (AI) were full. Okay, that's fine, I thought, my fault for making a mistake on the enrollment date. 

However, when I looked for other classes, I noticed that there aren't remotely close to the normal number of classes being offered at all this semester. Did a bunch of profs retire or something?? 407 (mobile dev), 559 (graphics), and 532 (matrix ML) are all unavailable. To my knowledge 407 was already supposed to be a spring-only course? 

I emailed my advisor about the issue and the only class she could get me a spot in was 570 (HCI). No offense to anyone teaching that class, but I personally don't think that class would be particularly useful to my professional career. 

I've already gone through the most of the shitty experience that is undergrad CS at UW - the only ""useful"" (in the words of other people) classes I've taken being OS and Algos, both of which I had to mostly self teach or spend more time with TAs than going to lecture. It's extremely frustrating and disappointing that my last semester is looking like this so far.

I've considered not enrolling at all in the spring and just coming back next fall in the hope the department can get their shit together. I am of course job hunting, but I haven't accepted anything yet and I'm not doing that well interview-wise anyways.

1. The course website. If you weren't there on the first day and missed when he wrote the webpage on the board (incorrectly), then sorry! It's not on the canvas, which was made after the class started.
2. The lectures. I don't think I have referenced my notes once. I and many others I know have stopped showing up completely and it hasn't hindered my performance in the slightest. Going through examples of random algorithms, standing right in front of what you're writing in tiny letters that can't be read, and rambling about nonsense facts for minutes on end in what feels like .5x speed makes for the most dry, useless lecture I've ever had.

It also means that there is nearly nothing to study from for exams. The textbook examples are so easy they're completely useless. The TAs actively tell us not to study from our notes. The homework, which becomes the only thing I can use as a study reference, didn't have the answers released until the day before the midterm. Also - one of the solutions written by the professor was wrong, according to my TA. This forced me to start studying the day before the exam, for my hardest class. Nice!

3. Now for the BULK of this rant - the grading. Actually, what the fuck. For those who aren't in this class, the only homework that has been graded in full (all 3 questions) is homework 1. Homework 2, which was due October 6, only has 2/3 graded. Homework 3: 2/3 graded. Homework 4: 2/3 graded. Homework 5: 1/3 graded.(homework 4 and 5 have just been graded over the past 2 days, so those are just barely in). This means that it is almost 2 MONTHS since our homework 2 was due, and it STILL is not fully in.

Our midterm, which we had mid October, took over a month to go into the grade book. And when it started to go in, it was graded for about 1/4 of the class on one day, then was removed from the gradebook for them hours later. Then, another chunk of the class had their midterm grades released and those stayed up. For the majority of the class, we did not have our exams put in the grade book for another 4 days. After the drop deadline, which they promised to have them in by. Either way - over a month after the exam was taken.

Yes, I submitted my course evaluation, however I don't expect it to do much. I just hate this class.

tl/dr: the lectures are useless, there's nothing to study from, and the grading system is abysmal",r6vqd3,56,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/r6vqd3/a_rant_about_cs577_with_eric_bach/

Transfering to CS

Howdy,

I am a sophomore at UTSA(University of Texas at San Antonio) majoring in CS and have a 4.0 gpa. I also did a summer internship at Hewlett Packard and have personal projects. I know that it is extremley hard to transfer into CS major at UWMadison. Do you have any tips for me before I apply for the Fall

I've gotten off the waitlist before for CS classes (CS300) when they opened up additional seats, and that was usually within a week or so.

I had recommendations to take CS 220 from another post I did, so I’m curious what are your experiences with either.

I saw Andrew Kuemmel had really good rating a on RMP, and Meena Syamkumar had decent. Cole Nelson had none. Jim Williams (CS 200) had average ratings, but I was told some of those ratings are over exaggerating.",r33q66,8,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/r33q66/cs_200_vs_cs_220/

I am a high school senior and applied to UW-Madison as Ealy Action for direct entry to Business. I feel I have a strong chance for that based on my profile. I tried to search it online but could not find that in case I want to change my major to CS after admission, is it possible or CS transfer is difficult? Also, how difficult to do a Business + CS as a double major if you get admitted as a business student?

Just curious, as I submitted my app in early action and the result will be out sometime in Feb, is it possible or advisable to reach to Admission Officer to change the major for my application from Business to CS?
